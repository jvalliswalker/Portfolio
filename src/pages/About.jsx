            <span className="fw-bolder">Hi there!</span> My name is Jamil
            Vallis-Walker. I'm a full time developer and long time tech
            tinkerer. I've been coding in Python and Apex for over five years,
            and I've just finished a six month course in web development (MERN)
            through UC Berkeley Extension. I'm excited to take the next step in
            my career and get started with this new skill set.
